## Concept

Ever wondered which pizza place to order your pizza from? Which deal is better? Two 12'' pizzas for $25 or one large 25'' for 36? 
Wonder no more, mix two deals as you please and make a calculated (literally) choice.

And if you want to, play around with a few currencies - might come in handy if you're abroad.
